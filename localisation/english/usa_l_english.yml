 USA_john_winston:0 "John Winston"
 USA_john_winston_desc:0 "The most democrat democrat to ever democracy for the democrats, John Winston is about as boring of a president as you can imagine. Born in 1998, he studied economics in university and involved himself in hard-center politics in his 20s. Following Cortez's rapid reforms during her presidency, he gained popularity as a more pragmatic, level-headed and predictable counterpart to Cortez. While he was very popular in his first term and in the first few months of his second term, he rapidly lost popularity due to him meeting rising geopolitical tensions across the world with very limited reaction."
 USA_amir_xerxes:0 "Amir Xerxes"
 USA_amir_xerxes_desc:0 "A WW3 veteran and successful large business owner, Amir Xerxes has been a supporter of technocratic policies and politics since he was a teenager. Always interested in new technologies, Amir Xerxes had been a large fan of great minds of the past such as Einstein and Tesla, and a big proponent of technocratic demagogues of the present day, preaching Elon Musk's words with fanatic passion."

 USA_great_awakening:0 "The 5th Great Awakening"
 USA_great_awakening_desc:0 "The Culture Wars have been unexpectedly won with the advent of the 5th Great Awakening of the 2040's, which led to the resurgence and spread of Evangelical, Pentacostal and Charismatic sects across the United States. The United States has become overwhelmingly Christian, with its secular constitution warped and changed to fit the agenda of Christian Nationalists."
 USA_post_automation:0 "Post-Automation Economy"
 USA_post_automation_desc:0 "America is one of the first nations to advance into a post-scarcity economy, and with it has automated a large portion of their lower and lower-middle class into unemployment. UBI programs such as the Yang Program has alleviated the class divide somewhat, but the struggle between the haves and have-nots are still ongoing. The United States is the first economy of its kind, and as a result has a considerably stronger economy."
 USA_second_amendment:0 "The 2nd Amendment"
 USA_second_amendment_desc:0 ""Shall not be infringed" has become a rallying cry for the American nationalist right. American civilian firearm ownership is higher today than even the ludicrious heights of the 2020's. Supporters say it is a bulwark against tyranny, and a deterrent to invasion, while detractors say an invasion of the mainland US is a lunatic conspiracy theory, and that they could never fight the government on even ground."
